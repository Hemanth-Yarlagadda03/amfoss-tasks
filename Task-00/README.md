# Installing Ubuntu 20.04 

This task was obviosly not very difficult due the vast resources online available which aided me in completing this task. 
My system being a UEFI system and also automatically allocating a drive for the ubuntu allowed the process to go very smoothly.
I really had no idea to dual boot intallation of operating systems before but I used the help of (https://itsfoss.com/install-ubuntu-1404-dual-boot-mode-windows-8-81-uefi/)
to assist me in the process.

There were no hiccups and my data is still intact despite not backing it up.
