# Begin your journey with Linux and Git

This was some task,for a guy who never used Linux or Git this task definitely made me work hard;despite that now after finishing I look back at myself how elementary it was.It was a great learning experience to start a task with knowing nothing about it,and definetly a the task accomplishes its goal to teach introduce newbies to GIT and Linux.
