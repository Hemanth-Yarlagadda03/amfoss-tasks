# Begin your journey with Linux and Git

This was some task,for a guy who never used Linux or Git this task definitely made me work hard;despite that now after finishing I look back at it to see how elementary it was.It was a great learning experience to start a task with knowing nothing about it,and definetly the task accomplishes its goal to teach introduce newbies to GIT and Linux.And Ofcourse,the coordinate leads to our Amritapuri Campus.
