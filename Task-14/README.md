This was a very fun and engaging task and I think I reaped my rewards after toiling pretty hard in task-02 learning the commands.<br>This definitely taught me how awesome a terminal is and also how to use the internet and the man command to aid you incase of any trouble.Overall,I feel like I learned a lot and the tasks definetlt fulfilled its purpose.
