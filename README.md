## About Me :
I had a no prior experince with coding as my school didn't have a solid stage or a program for computer science. I never showed enough attention towards it as I was considering other career options and was occupied with other things. But due to a turn in events, I chose to pursue Computer Science. In any field of study I choose,I try to get the most of it and try to round my skills and try to become an expert in it rather than spending my time on other frivilous things.I decided to join Amfoss for reasons which that is a part of too.All the effort and time,I put in during the tasks are well worth even I if I there is a chance I might not be admitted as to me knowledge is the paramount and everything comes next.The tasks had me engaged and learned a lot during this period given that my first programming language I have been introduced to is Python in our PSAT class.;)


# About the tasks :
I think the tasks are great learning experience and provide good challenge for those who are new to programming. I didnot attempt all of them and can't really comment on the overall difficulty of the tasks but for me they were both as enjoyable as they were tricky and challenging. I do have some regrets on how I would have gone about it regarding the order but overall from the time I have started to now I have I've learned a lot that I wouldn't have learned in the classroom that is where I beleive that the tasks haved succeeded along with many other things
