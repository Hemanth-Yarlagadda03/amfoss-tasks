 **Introspection**  

***Why must we choose you?***

I am very enthusiastic about technology like every other person is but by being part of this club I believe that I can be proficient in the skills that are offered or gained. I always hope to tap every ounce of my ability for the benefit of the club, the community and lastly for myself. At AmFoss, I believe that my passion in computer science will be greatly appreciated and that the mentoring and the hands on experience I would get would guide me to a better path in both interpersonal skills and more so for technical skills.


***What is your plan for the next 6 months?***

I really do not keep unrealistic expectations for myself and in the next six months my goal is to explore and dig myself deeper into the world of coding and concentrate in my academics and translate those learnings for practical purposes. In doing so I hope that during my journey with the club I would be able find a more specific field of my liking that I would like to delve more into.


***How would you contribute back to the club?

I would like to contribute to the club in as many ways as possible to the limit of my strengths and abilities.


***Do you have any feedback for the selection process?

None to be honest, maybe keep up the good work. The tasks were great learning experience and helped me expand my horizons.
